# Custom Functions

## Module Introduction

This module introduces custom PL/SQL functions in Oracle SQL. You'll learn how to write, understand, and use reusable logic encapsulated in user-defined functions. These functions simplify SQL statements and are especially useful in reporting tasks that involve business rules.

## Explanation

### Custom Function Conceptual Overview

Custom functions in Oracle are reusable blocks of PL/SQL logic that return a single value. They're used in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses just like built-in functions.

**Benefits:**

* Reuse across queries and reports
* Clean, readable SQL
* Easier updates to business logic

**Example Use Case**: Calculate the next business day based on a given date and skip holidays stored in the `HOLIDAY` table.

**Reference**: Chapter 17

### Custom Function Metadata

Functions have:

* **Input Parameters**: Data sent to the function.
* **Return Value**: A single result.
* **Local Variables**: Temporary values used in the function.
* **Body**: The logic executed when the function is called.

**Example**: Define a custom function `next_business_day`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION next_business_day(i_date DATE)
RETURN DATE IS
  v_date DATE;
BEGIN
  v_date := i_date;
  SELECT NVL(MAX(holiday_end_date)+1, v_date)
  INTO v_date
  FROM holiday
  WHERE v_date BETWEEN holiday_start_date AND holiday_end_date;
  RETURN v_date;
END;
```

This function returns the next business day, skipping holidays found in the holiday table.

### Usage

Custom functions are called like any other function:

```sql
SELECT student_id, next_business_day(ENROLL_DATE) AS next_day
FROM enrollment;
```

This query applies the custom function to each enrollment date to find the next business day.

**Output**:

```
STUDENT_ID   NEXT_DAY
-----------  ---------
        102  09-AUG-10
```

You can also use them in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and even `JOIN` conditions.

## Exercises

1. **Call a Custom Function**
   Use the function `next_business_day` to find the next business day after each enrollment in the `ENROLLMENT` table. Show `STUDENT_ID`, `SECTION_ID`, `ENROLL_DATE`, and the next business day.

2. **Filter with a Custom Function**
   Select rows from `ENROLLMENT` where the next business day is more than two days after `ENROLL_DATE`.

3. **Custom Function with `TO_CHAR`**
   Return the weekday of the `next_business_day` for each `ENROLL_DATE` using `TO_CHAR`.

4. **Join with a Custom Function**
   Join `ENROLLMENT` and `SECTION` on `SECTION_ID`, and use `next_business_day(ENROLL_DATE)` to show when each student is expected to start.

5. **Use in Subquery**
   Select students whose `ENROLL_DATE` is not on a business day by comparing it to `next_business_day(ENROLL_DATE)`.

6. **Aggregate with Custom Function**
   Count how many enrollments fall on holidays by checking where `ENROLL_DATE != next_business_day(ENROLL_DATE)`.

## Q&A

* Why are custom functions useful for reporting?
* What kind of logic should be placed in a custom function vs a view?
* How does using a custom function affect query performance?
* What are some limitations of using custom functions in `WHERE` clauses?
* When should you create a custom function versus using existing Oracle functions?
* How do you handle error conditions within custom functions?
* What are the security considerations when creating custom functions?

FROM enrollment;
```

**4.**

```sql
